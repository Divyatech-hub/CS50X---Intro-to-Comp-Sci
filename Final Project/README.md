## Description: 
This is a user-friendly and fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It is a test of presence of mind and quick reflexes. It’s programmed in Python using the IDE - Thonny. 

### Rules of the Game: 
There is only ONE MAIN rule you must follow! 
Once you begin the game, names of colours will be displayed on the screen. 
But note that font colour of the word will be in a different colour than the colour the word represents. So, your task is to write down the FONT COLOUR of the word and NOT the WORD ITSELF! You’ll have a total of 30 seconds to build your score as much as you can. One point for each correct attempt. Incorrect attempts, will give you another chance to try. 

### Benefits: 
The benefits of 'THE COLOUR GAME- Not as it seems' are several. 
1. It is a game for people of all ages to play. 
2. It's a great antidote to boredom. 
3. It's a one-player game but can be mutliplayer too if you take turns and have a go. 
4. And best of all, it tests your concentration, presence of mind, and quick reflexes. Have fun playing:)

#### Technologies used:
1. PYTHON - The game is programmed in Python using the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Thonny. 
2. TKINTER - I used the library tkinter for my project. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
3. CS50 IDE - And of course I also used the CS50 IDE to create the README file.
4. To create a logo for my project I used an online logo maker website (for free)
5. I used the Active Presenter App to screen record my video
6. The video presentation was created on Microsoft Powerpoint.

#### Concept or idea: 
Initially I had no clue as to what to do for my final project, but I knew deep down I wanted to create some sort of project which would be fun to use and would be enjoyed by people of all ages.
So i went for a game that would be based on colours and testing one's presence of mind and concentration. 
The key to winning the game is being quick and focussed. 
My game is a great stress buster for any one. Hope you enjoy playing:)

#### Design:
I went for a very minimalistic design of the GUI. 
The rules of the game written on top, below which there is a score counter variable that keeps track of your correct responses. There is also a timer which ticks down from 30 seconds to 0 seconds.
The colourred word appears in bold and large font at the centre of the screen. The colours of the word keep changing and the words change along with that too in a random fashion.
